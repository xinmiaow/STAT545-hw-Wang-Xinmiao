## To-Dos List

- [X] detect_fct(): detect factors that should be character
- [X] reorder(): write a version of reorder() that uses desc() a la (d)plyr
- [X] factor_asis():  sets levels to the order in which they appear in the data
- [X] Submit the assignment

## Report My Process

I think this assignment is not hard as long as I follow the tutorial on the course website. I can get started on develop a package. However, it takes time to develop a comprehensive function which consider as many potential errors as possible.
