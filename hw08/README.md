## Description about My App

This app is designed to summary the information of products at BC Liquor store. 

There is a histogram which summarized the alcohol content. You can personalize the histogram by adjusting the range of price, selecting the type of product, filtering the data by country, and choosing the color of the histogram. 

In addition, there is also a table which contains all the filtered information. You can sort the data by price and download the dataset as well.
